Shoefull is a test project using a Rust library called ggez to "create a Good Game Easily."

Shoefull is displayed using the Rust canvas and only uses keyboard inputs to allow the user to navigate through the menu/play the game. The latest release only consists of a simple target practice mode where the player must collide with randomly generated targets while dashing in the fastest time possible to reach a score of 10.
